# Day-Projects
smaller projects, where I try to deepen newly learned things and thereby create added value for myself. <br/><br/>The special thing about these projects is that they are created in one day, so these projects can also have bugs and other errors. Sometimes I will fix these bugs, but sometimes even if the project has little added value for me, I will not fix bugs.
