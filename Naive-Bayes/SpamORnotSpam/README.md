# SpamAI in Node js
A spam AI built with the Native-Bayes algorithm to classify an email as spam or not spam based on the email subject. 
## Motivation
During my university summer vacation, I wanted to do some research on artificial intelligence. I read books and watched videos on the subject. My goal was to create an exercise project on the topic, which does not have to do with neural networks. That's when I got an idea. I have so many different emails that you lose track of which ones are important and which ones are not. All email accounts of me are some kind of spam accounts, I get so many emails there, that it's easy to lose the overview, which are important and which are not. Then I had the idea why not just solve it with Ki. The main idea was to write an email bot, which can solve by AI if the email is relevant or not.  If the email is relevant. Send it to my main email address. Also I built a dashboard which shows the classified email subjects and I can choose there if spam or not spam, so the ki learns correctly.
