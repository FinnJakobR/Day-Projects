# Simple HTTP SERVER in C
In this project I dealt with network protocols, especially HTTP and TCP. I wrote a simple HTTP server in c, which does nothing else than handle Get and Post requests.
## Motivation
For my Google Home project I needed a server that can handle Get and Post requests. I always knew HTTP server as simple nodejs express libarys or one line commands in python. But that did not satisfy me anymore. I wanted to know what the HTTP protocol looks like and how it works. During my research I came across with TCP (Maybe in the future i will make a projekt only for TCP) which is responsible for transferring requests. And what is better and possible to code programs from stratch, exactly the C language.
